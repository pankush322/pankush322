# Hi, I am Pankush

I build lean, production-ready APIs and developer tools with Python, FastAPI, and a strong focus on automation. I enjoy turning validation-heavy workflows into simple services that teams can plug into immediately.

## What I am focusing on
- Shipping fast iterations on [validation-api-fastapi](https://github.com/pankush322/validation-api-fastapi) to keep email, phone, PAN, GSTIN, and IBAN rules up-to-date
- Exploring ways to make data entry safer through real-time validation and rate-limited endpoints
- Investing in CI/CD, testing, and observability so side projects feel like production systems

## Skills and tooling
- Languages: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL
- Frameworks: FastAPI, React, Next.js
- Platforms: Render, GitHub Actions, Docker
- Testing & quality: Pytest, Postman/Newman, automated smoke tests

## Selected projects
- [validation-api-fastapi](https://github.com/pankush322/validation-api-fastapi) – RapidAPI-ready service that validates common identifiers without any persistent storage
- [qr-barcode-studio](https://github.com/pankush322/qr-barcode-studio) – Offline-first PWA for creating high-quality QR and barcode assets
- [youtube-chapters-maker](https://github.com/pankush322/youtube-chapters-maker) – Tooling that speeds up chapter creation from long-form videos

## How to reach me
- Open an issue or discussion on any of the repos above
- Drop a message on GitHub if you would like to collaborate on validation tooling or developer experience projects
